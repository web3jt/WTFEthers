# WTF Ethers: 3. Read Contract Information

I've been revisiting `ethers.js` recently to refresh my understanding of the details and to write a simple tutorial called "WTF Ethers" for beginners.

In this lesson, we will introduce the `Contract` class and use it to read information from contracts on Ethereum.

## The `Contract` Class

In `ethers`, the `Contract` class is an abstraction of contracts (EVM bytecode) deployed on the Ethereum network. Through it, developers can easily read (`call`) and transact with contracts, as well as obtain transaction results and events. The power of Ethereum lies in its contracts, so it is essential to have a good understanding of contract operations.

## Creating a `Contract` Variable

### Read-only and Read-write Contracts

`Contract` objects can be divided into two types: read-only and read-write. Read-only `Contract` objects can only read contract information on the chain by executing `call` operations, which involve calling the `view` and `pure` functions in the contract. They cannot perform `transaction` operations. The methods of creating these two types of `Contract` variables are different:

- Read-only `Contract` variable: The parameters are the contract address, contract `abi`, and `provider` variable (read-only).

```javascript
const contract = new ethers.Contract(`address`, `abi`, `provider`);
```

- Read-write `Contract` variable: The parameters are the contract address, contract `abi`, and `signer` variable. The `Signer` is another class in `ethers` that is used for signing transactions, which we will cover later.

```javascript
const contract = new ethers.Contract(`address`, `abi`, `signer`);
```

**Note:** In `ethers`, the `call` operation refers to a read-only operation, which is different from the `call` in `Solidity`.

## Reading Contract Information

### 1. Creating a Provider

We will use the Alchemy node's API Key to create a `Provider`:
```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
// Connect to the Ethereum network using the Alchemy RPC node
// Prepare alchemy API, refer to https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTFSolidity/blob/main/Topics/Tools/TOOL04_Alchemy/readme.md
const ALCHEMY_MAINNET_URL = 'https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/oKmOQKbneVkxgHZfibs-iFhIlIAl6HDN';
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(ALCHEMY_MAINNET_URL);
```

### 2. Creating a Read-only Contract Instance

To create a read-only contract instance, we need to provide three parameters: the contract address, contract `abi`, and `provider` variable. The contract address can be found online, and we have already created the `provider` variable in the previous step. But how do we fill in the `abi`?

`ABI` (Application Binary Interface) is the standard for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts. For more information, refer to [WTF Solidity Tutorials Lesson 27: ABI Encoding](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity/blob/main/27_ABIEncode/readme.md). `ethers` supports two ways of providing `abi`:

- **Method 1:** Directly input the contract `abi`. You can copy it from the compilation page of Remix, generate it locally when compiling contracts (located in the `artifact` folder), or obtain it from the code page of an open-source contract on Etherscan. We will use this method to create an instance of the `WETH` contract:

```javascript
// Method 1: Copy the full ABI
// You can copy the WETH_ABI from here: https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#code
const WETH_ABI = '[{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"name","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"string"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view",...omitted for brevity...]';
const WETH_address = '0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2' // WETH Contract
const WETH_contract = new ethers.Contract(WETH_address, WETH_ABI, provider)

```

- **Method 2:** Since the readability of `abi` is poor, `ethers` introduces an innovative approach called `Human-Readable Abi`. Developers can write `abi` using `function signature` and `event signature`. We will use this method to create an instance of the stable coin `DAI`:

```javascript
// Method 2: Input the functions needed for the program, separated by commas. ethers will automatically convert them into the corresponding abi for you.
// Human-readable abi, using the example of an ERC20 contract
const abiERC20 = [
    "function name() view returns (string)",
    "function symbol() view returns (string)",
    "function totalSupply() view returns (uint256)",
    "function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint)",
];
const addressDAI = '0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F' // DAI Contract
const contractDAI = new ethers.Contract(addressDAI, abiERC20, provider)
```

### 3. Reading on-chain information of `WETH` and `DAI`

We can use the read-only `Contract` instance to call the `view` and `pure` functions of the contract to obtain on-chain information:

```javascript
const main = async () => {
    // 1. Reading on-chain information of the WETH contract (WETH abi)
  const name = await WETH_contract.name();
  const symbol = await WETH_contract.symbol();
  const totalSupply = await WETH_contract.totalSupply();

  console.log(`\nReading from ${WETH_address}\n`);
  console.log(`Name: ${name}`);
  console.log(`Symbol: ${symbol}`);
  console.log(`Total Supply: ${ethers.formatEther(totalSupply)}`);

  const balanceAddress = 'vitalik.eth';
  const balance = await WETH_contract.balanceOf('vitalik.eth');
  console.log(`Vitalik's Balance: ${ethers.formatEther(balance)}\n`);

    // 2. Reading on-chain information of the DAI contract (ERC20 interface contract)
  const name = await DAI_contract.name();
  const symbol = await DAI_contract.symbol();
  const totalSupply = await DAI_contract.totalSupply();

  console.log(`\nReading from ${DAI_address}\n`);
  console.log(`Name: ${name}`);
  console.log(`Symbol: ${symbol}`);
  console.log(`Total Supply: ${ethers.formatEther(totalSupply)}`);

  const balanceAddress = 'vitalik.eth';
  const balance = await DAI_contract.balanceOf('vitalik.eth');
  console.log(`Vitalik's Balance: ${ethers.formatEther(balance)}\n`);
};

main()
```

As you can see, instances of contracts created using both methods can successfully interact with the blockchain. Vitalik's wallet contains `0.05 WETH` and `555508 DAI`, as shown in the figure below.

**Explanation:**
We can verify the balance of `WETH` in Vitalik's wallet and whether it matches the one read from the `Contract` using the [Ethereum browser](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#readContract). By using [ENS](https://app.ens.domains/name/vitalik.eth/details), we found that Vitalik's wallet address is `0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045`. By using the `balanceOf` contract method, we obtained a balance of exactly `0.05 WETH`. The conclusion is consistent!

## Summary

In this lesson, we introduced the `Contract` class in `ethers` and created read-only `Contract` instances for `WETH` and `DAI`. We successfully read Vitalik's balances for these two tokens.
